title: 'VIOLA: Object-Centric Imitation Learning for Vision-Based Robot Manipulation'
section: Poster
openreview: L8hCfhPbFho
abstract: 'We introduce VIOLA, an object-centric imitation learning approach to learning
  closed-loop visuomotor policies for robot manipulation. Our approach constructs
  object-centric representations based on general object proposals from a pre-trained
  vision model. VIOLA uses a transformer-based policy to reason over these representations
  and attend to the task-relevant visual factors for action prediction. Such object-based
  structural priors improve deep imitation learning algorithm’s robustness against
  object variations and environmental perturbations. We quantitatively evaluate VIOLA
  in simulation and on real robots. VIOLA outperforms the state-of-the-art imitation
  learning methods by 45.8% in success rate. It has also been deployed successfully
  on a physical robot to solve challenging long-horizon tasks, such as dining table
  arrangement and coffee making. More videos and model details can be found in supplementary
  material and the project website:  https://ut-austin-rpl.github.io/VIOLA/.'
