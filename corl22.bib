	abstract = {We aim to build a useful, reproducible, democratized benchmark for learning household robotic manipulation from human videos. To realize this goal, a diverse, high-quality human video dataset curated specifically for robots is desired. To evaluate the learning progress, a simulated twin environment that resembles the appearance and the dynamics of the physical world would help roboticists and AI researchers validate their algorithms convincingly and efficiently before testing on a real robot. Hence, we present RoboTube, a human video dataset, and its digital twins for learning various robotic manipulation tasks. RoboTube video dataset contains 5,000 video demonstrations recorded with multi-view RGB-D cameras of human-performing everyday household tasks including manipulation of rigid objects, articulated objects, deformable objects, and bimanual manipulation. RT-sim, as the simulated twin environments, consists of 3D scanned, photo-realistic objects, minimizing the visual domain gap between the physical world and the simulated environment. After extensively benchmarking existing methods in the field of robot learning from videos, the empirical results suggest that knowledge and models learned from the RoboTube video dataset can be deployed, benchmarked, and reproduced in RT-sim and be transferred to a real robot. We hope RoboTube can lower the barrier to robotics research for beginners while facilitating reproducible research in the community.

For example, we may tug at a table leg to evaluate whether it is built well, or turn a water bottle upside down to check that it is watertight. We propose to train robots to acquire such interactive behaviors automatically, for the purpose of evaluating the result of an attempted robotic skill execution. These evaluations in turn serve as "interactive reward functions" (IRFs) for training reinforcement learning policies to perform the target skill, such as screwing the table leg tightly. In addition, even after task policies are fully trained, IRFs can serve as verification mechanisms that improve online task execution. For any given task, our IRFs can be conveniently trained using only examples of successful outcomes, and no further specification is needed to train the task policy thereafter. In our evaluations on door locking and weighted block stacking in simulation, and screw tightening on a real robot, IRFs enable large performance improvements, even outperforming baselines with access to demonstrations or carefully engineered rewards.}

Different strategies generalize differently and can be chosen in real-time for new tasks or environments, bypassing the need for time-consuming retraining. We release a fast, robust open-source MoB locomotion controller, Walk These Ways, that can execute diverse gaits with variable footswing, posture, and speed, unlocking diverse downstream tasks: crouching, hopping, high-speed running, stair traversal, bracing against shoves, rhythmic dance, and more.

Current state-of-the-art algorithms often use inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), where given a set of expert demonstrations, an agent alternatively infers a reward function and the associated optimal policy. However, such IRL approaches often require substantial online interactions for complex control problems. In this work, we present Regularized Optimal Transport (ROT), a new imitation learning algorithm that builds on recent advances in optimal transport based trajectory-matching. Our key technical insight is that adaptively combining trajectory-matching rewards with behavior cloning can significantly accelerate imitation even with only a few demonstrations. Our experiments on 20 visual control tasks across the DeepMind Control Suite, the OpenAI Robotics Suite, and the Meta-World Benchmark demonstrate an average of 7.8x faster imitation to reach 90\% of expert performance compared to prior state-of-the-art methods. On real-world robotic manipulation, with just one demonstration and an hour of online training, ROT achieves an average success rate of 90.1\% across 14 tasks.}

In this paper, we present ReViND, the first offline RL system for robotic navigation that can leverage previously collected data to optimize user-specified reward functions in the real-world. We evaluate our system for off-road navigation without any additional data collection or fine-tuning, and show that it can navigate to distant goals using only offline training from this dataset, and exhibit behaviors that qualitatively differ based on the user-specified reward function.}

However, most prior works are still limited by training from a relatively restricted domain of videos. In this paper, we argue that the true potential of third-person IRL lies in increasing the diversity of videos for better scaling. To learn a reward function from diverse videos, we propose to perform graph abstraction on the videos followed by temporal matching in the graph space to measure the task progress. Our insight is that a task can be described by entity interactions that form a graph, and this graph abstraction can help remove irrelevant information such as textures, resulting in more robust reward functions. We evaluate our approach, GraphIRL, on cross-embodiment learning in X-MAGICAL and learning from human demonstrations for real-robot manipulation. We show significant improvements in robustness to diverse video demonstrations over previous approaches, and even achieve better results than manual reward design on a real robot pushing task.

We look at sample-based methods from the perspective of inference-based control, specifically posterior policy iteration. From this perspective, we highlight how Gaussian noise priors produce rough control actions that are unsuitable for physical robot deployment. Considering smoother Gaussian process priors, as used in episodic reinforcement learning and motion planning, we demonstrate how smoother model predictive control can be achieved using online sequential inference. This inference is realized through an efficient factorization of the action distribution, and novel means of optimizing the likelihood temperature for to improve importance sampling accuracy. We evaluate this approach on several high-dimensional robot control tasks, matching the sample efficiency of prior heuristic methods while also ensuring smoothness.

In this work, we identify the roots of this challenge as the failure of a learned continuous policy to satisfy the discrete plan implicit in the demonstration. By utilizing modes (rather than subgoals) as the discrete abstraction and motion policies with both mode invariance and goal reachability properties, we prove our learned continuous policy can simulate any discrete plan specified by a linear temporal logic (LTL) formula. Consequently, an imitator is robust to both task- and motion-level perturbations and guaranteed to achieve task success.}

However, how to effectively make use of diverse multi-task data for novel downstream tasks still remains a grand challenge in reinforcement learning and robotics. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a framework that acquires goal-conditioned policies for unseen temporally extended tasks via offline reinforcement learning on broad data, in combination with online fine-tuning guided by subgoals in a learned lossy representation space. When faced with a novel task goal, our framework uses an affordance model to plan a sequence of lossy representations as subgoals that decomposes the original task into easier problems. Learned from the broad prior data, the lossy representation emphasizes task-relevant information about states and goals while abstracting away redundant contexts that hinder generalization. It thus enables subgoal planning for unseen tasks, provides a compact input to the policy, and facilitates reward shaping during fine-tuning. We show that our framework can be pre-trained on large-scale datasets of robot experience from prior work and efficiently fine-tuned for novel tasks, entirely from visual inputs without any manual reward engineering.}

A variety of scene interactions are possible, including poking with force sensing to determine rigidity, measuring local material type with single-pixel spectroscopy or predicting force distributions by pushing. Sparse experimental interactions are guided by entropy to enable high efficiency, with tabletop scene properties densely mapped from scratch in a few minutes from a few tens of interactions.}

We demonstrate that our method is able to improve the performance by 46\% on adversarial data and at the cost of only 3\% performance degradation on clean data, compared to the model trained with clean data. Additionally, compared to existing robust methods, our method can improve performance by 21\% on adversarial examples and 9\% on clean data. Our robust model is evaluated with a planner to study its downstream impacts. We demonstrate that our model can significantly reduce the severe accident rates (e.g., collisions and off-road driving).}

It is also biological implausible given evidence for strong motor synergies across limbs. In this work, we propose to learn a unified policy for whole-body control of a legged manipulator using reinforcement learning. We propose Regularized Online Adaptation to bridge the Sim2Real gap for high-DoF control, and Advantage Mixing exploiting the causal dependency in the action space to overcome local minima during training the whole-body system.

Previous work in extrinsic dexterity usually has careful assumptions about contacts which impose restrictions on robot design, robot motions, and the variations of the physical parameters. In this work, we develop a system based on reinforcement learning (RL) to address these limitations. We study the task of "Occluded Grasping" which aims to grasp the object in configurations that are initially occluded; the robot needs to move the object into a configuration from which these grasps can be achieved. We present a system with model-free RL that successfully achieves this task using a simple gripper with extrinsic dexterity. The policy learns emergent behaviors of pushing the object against the wall to rotate and then grasp it without additional reward terms on extrinsic dexterity. We discuss important components of the system including the design of the RL problem, multi-grasp training and selection, and policy generalization with automatic curriculum. Most importantly, the policy trained in simulation is zero-shot transferred to a physical robot. It demonstrates dynamic and contact-rich motions with a simple gripper that generalizes across objects with various size, density, surface friction, and shape with a 78\% success rate. }

Previous approaches either lack uncertainty estimates for the map and agent state, do not run in real-time, do not have a dense scene representation or do not model agent dynamics. Our solution reconciles all of these aspects. We start from a predefined state-space model which combines differentiable rendering and 6-DoF dynamics. Probabilistic inference in this model amounts to simultaneous localisation and mapping (SLAM) and is intractable. We use a series of approximations to Bayesian inference to arrive at probabilistic map and state estimates. We take advantage of well-established methods and closed-form updates, preserving accuracy and enabling real-time capability. The proposed solution runs at 10Hz real-time and is similarly accurate to state-of-the-art SLAM in small to medium-sized indoor environments, with high-speed UAV and handheld camera agents (Blackbird, EuRoC and TUM-RGBD).

We present a method to predict the inherent difficulty of a driving situation given data collected from a fleet of autonomous vehicles deployed on public roads. We then demonstrate that this difficulty score can be used in a zero-shot transfer to generate curricula for an imitation-learning based planning agent.

To tackle this challenge, we propose a new algorithm, LEarning Attention over Driving bEhavioRs (LEADER), which learns to attend to critical human behaviors during planning. LEADER learns a neural network generator to provide attention over human behaviors; it integrates the attention into a belief-space planner through importance sampling, which biases planning towards critical events. To train the attention generator, we form a minimax game between the generator and the planner. By solving this minimax game, LEADER learns to perform risk-aware planning without explicit human effort on data labeling.}

The ability to train policies in simulation enables safe exploration and large-scale data collection quickly at low cost. However, prior works in sim-to-real transfer of robotic policies typically do not involve any human-robot interaction because accurately simulating human behavior is an open problem. In this work, our goal is to leverage the power of simulation to train robotic policies that are proficient at interacting with humans upon deployment. But there is a chicken and egg problem --- how to gather examples of a human interacting with a physical robot so as to model human behavior in simulation without already having a robot that is able to interact with a human? Our proposed method, Iterative-Sim-to-Real (i-S2R), attempts to address this. i-S2R bootstraps from a simple model of human behavior and alternates between training in simulation and deploying in the real world. In each iteration, both the human behavior model and the policy are refined. For all training we apply a new evolutionary search algorithm called Blackbox Gradient Sensing (BGS). We evaluate our method on a real world robotic table tennis setting, where the objective for the robot is to play cooperatively with a human player for as long as possible. Table tennis is a high-speed, dynamic task that requires the two players to react quickly to each other’s moves, making for a challenging test bed for research on human-robot interaction. We present results on an industrial robotic arm that is able to cooperatively play table tennis with human players, achieving rallies of 22 successive hits on average and 150 at best. Further, for 80\% of players, rally lengths are 70\% to 175\% longer compared to the sim-to-real plus fine-tuning (S2R+FT) baseline.

We formulate an objective and corresponding algorithm which leads to unsupervised learning of a diverse set of skills through intrinsic motivation given a known state abstraction. The skills are jointly learned with the symbolic forward model which captures the effect of skill execution in the state abstraction. After training, we can leverage the skills as symbolic actions using the forward model for long-horizon planning and subsequently execute the plan using the learned continuous-action control skills. The proposed algorithm learns skills and forward models that can be used to solve complex tasks which require both continuous control and long-horizon planning capabilities with high success rate. It compares favorably with other flat and hierarchical reinforcement learning baseline agents and is successfully demonstrated with a real robot.}

Here, we propose a data-driven approach to this problem by em meta-learning priors for safe BO from offline data. We build on a meta-learning algorithm, F-PACOH, capable of providing reliable uncertainty quantification in settings of data scarcity. As core contribution, we develop a novel framework for choosing safety-compliant priors in a data-riven manner via empirical uncertainty metrics and a frontier search algorithm. On benchmark functions and a high-precision motion system, we demonstrate that our meta-learnt priors accelerate convergence of safe BO approaches while maintaining safety.

We analyze the optimization landscapes of diverse scenarios that contain both rigid bodies and deformable objects. In dynamic environments with highly deformable objects and fluids, differentiable simulators produce rugged landscapes with nonetheless useful gradients in some parts of the space. We propose a method that combines Bayesian optimization with semi-local 'leaps' to obtain a global search method that can use gradients effectively, while also maintaining robust performance in regions with noisy gradients. We show that our approach outperforms several gradient-based and gradient-free baselines on an extensive set of experiments in simulation, and also validate the method using experiments with a real robot and deformables.}

	abstract = {Large language models can encode a wealth of semantic knowledge about the world. Such knowledge could be extremely useful to robots aiming to act upon high-level, temporally extended instructions expressed in natural language. However, a significant weakness of language models is that they lack real-world experience, which makes it difficult to leverage them for decision making within a given embodiment. For example, asking a language model to describe how to clean a spill might result in a reasonable narrative, but it may not be applicable to a particular agent, such as a robot, that needs to perform this task in a particular environment. We propose to provide real-world grounding by means of pretrained skills, which are used to constrain the model to propose natural language actions that are both feasible and contextually appropriate. The robot can act as the language model’s “hands and eyes,” while the language model supplies high-level semantic knowledge about the task. We show how low-level skills can be combined with large language models so  that  the  language model  provides  high-level  knowledge about the procedures for performing complex and temporally extended instructions,  while  value  functions  associated  with  these  skills  provide  the  grounding necessary to connect this knowledge to a particular physical environment. We evaluate our method on a number of real-world robotic tasks, where we show the need for real-world grounding and that this approach is capable of completing long-horizon, abstract, natural language instructions on a mobile manipulator.

This framework takes in posed tactile images over time, and outputs an evolving distribution of sensor pose on the object's surface, without the need for visual priors. Our key insight is to estimate local surface geometry with tactile sensing, learn a compact representation for it, and disambiguate these signals over a long time horizon. The backbone of MidasTouch is a Monte-Carlo particle filter, with a measurement model based on a tactile code network learned from tactile simulation. This network, inspired by LIDAR place recognition, compactly summarizes local surface geometries. These generated codes are efficiently compared against a precomputed tactile codebook per-object, to update the pose distribution. We further release the YCB-Slide dataset of real-world and simulated forceful sliding interactions between a vision-based tactile sensor and standard YCB objects. While single-touch localization can be inherently ambiguous, we can quickly localize our sensor by traversing salient surface geometries. Project page: https://suddhu.github.io/midastouch-tactile/}

Our key insight is to leverage visual and haptic observations during interaction with an item to rapidly and reactively plan skewering motions. We learn a generalizable, multimodal representation for a food item from raw sensory inputs which informs the optimal skewering strategy. Given this representation, we propose a zero-shot framework to sense visuo-haptic properties of a previously unseen item and reactively skewer it, all within a single interaction. Real-robot experiments with foods of varying levels of visual and textural diversity demonstrate that our multimodal policy outperforms baselines which do not exploit both visual and haptic cues or do not reactively plan. Across 6 plates of different food items, our proposed framework achieves 71\% success over 69 skewering attempts total.

Moreover, we show that by using a Wasserstein GAN formulation and transitions from demonstrations with rough and partial information as input, we are able to extract policies that are robust and capable of imitating demonstrated behaviors.

We propose Evolving NeRF (Evo-NeRF), leveraging recent speedups in NeRF training and further extending it to rapidly train the NeRF representation concurrently to image capturing. Evo-NeRF terminates training early when a sufficient task confidence is achieved, evolves the NeRF weights from grasp to grasp to rapidly adapt to object removal, and applies additional geometry regularizations to make the reconstruction smoother and faster. General purpose grasp planners such as Dex-Net may underperform with NeRF outputs because there can be unreliable geometry from rapidly trained NeRFs. To mitigate this distribution shift, we propose a Radiance-Adjusted Grasp Network (RAG-Net), a grasping network adapted to NeRF's characteristics through training on depth rendered from NeRFs of synthetic scenes. In experiments, a physical YuMi robot using Evo-NeRF and RAG-Net achieves an 89\% grasp success rate over 27 trials on single objects, with early capture termination providing a 41\% speed improvement with no loss in reliability. In a sequential grasping task on 6 scenes, Evo-NeRF reusing network weights clears 72\% of the objects, retaining similar performance as reconstructing the NeRF from scratch (76\%) but using 61\% less sensing time.

A central question is how to effectively allocate limited human attention. Prior work addresses this in the single-robot, single-human setting; we formalize the Interactive Fleet Learning (IFL) setting, in which multiple robots interactively query and learn from multiple human supervisors. We propose Return on Human Effort (ROHE) as a new metric and Fleet-DAgger, a family of IFL algorithms. We present an open-source IFL benchmark suite of GPU-accelerated Isaac Gym environments for standardized evaluation and development of IFL algorithms. We compare a novel Fleet-DAgger algorithm to 4 baselines with 100 robots in simulation. We also perform a physical block-pushing experiment with 4 ABB YuMi robot arms and 2 remote humans. Experiments suggest that the allocation of humans to robots significantly affects the performance of the fleet, and that the novel Fleet-DAgger algorithm can achieve up to 8.8x higher ROHE than baselines.

Unfortunately, due to long-tail safety-critical events, the risk is often under-estimated by finite-sampling approximations of probabilistic motion forecasts. This can lead to overconfident and unsafe robot behavior, even with robust planners. Instead of assuming full prediction coverage that robust planners require, we propose to make prediction itself risk-aware. We introduce a new prediction objective to learn a risk-biased distribution over trajectories, so that risk evaluation simplifies to an expected cost estimation under this biased distribution. This reduces sample complexity of the risk estimation during online planning, which is needed for safe real-time performance. Evaluation results in a didactic simulation environment and on a real-world dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. The code and a demo are available.}

The traditional approach has been to decompose this problem into elevation mapping and foothold planning phases. The elevation mapping, however, is susceptible to failure and large noise artifacts, requires specialized hardware, and is biologically implausible. In this paper, we present the first end-to-end locomotion system capable of traversing stairs, curbs, stepping stones, and gaps. We show this result on a medium-sized quadruped robot using a single front-facing depth camera. The small size of the robot necessitates discovering specialized gait patterns not seen elsewhere. The egocentric camera requires the policy to remember past information to estimate the terrain under its hind feet. We train our policy in simulation. Training has two phases - first, we train a policy using reinforcement learning with a cheap-to-compute variant of depth image and then in phase 2 distill it into the final policy that uses depth using supervised learning. The resulting policy transfers to the real world and is able to run in real-time on the limited compute of the robot. It can traverse a large variety of terrain while being robust to perturbations like pushes, slippery surfaces, and rocky terrain. Videos are at https://vision-locomotion.github.io},

In this work, we claim that an ideal pushing dynamics model should have the SE(2)-equivariance property, i.e., if tabletop objects' poses and pushing action are transformed by some same planar rigid-body transformation, then the resulting motion should also be the result of the same transformation. Existing state-of-the-art data-driven approaches do not have this equivariance property, resulting in less-than-desirable learning performances. In this paper, we propose a new neural network architecture that by construction has the above equivariance property. Through extensive empirical validations, we show that the proposed model shows significantly improved learning performances over the existing methods. Also, we verify that our pushing dynamics model can be used for various downstream pushing manipulation tasks such as the object moving, singulation, and grasping in both simulation and real robot experiments.

To deal with the high dimensions of robot parameters, we propose an algorithm for multi-dimensional evolution path searching that allows joint optimization of both the robot evolution path and the policy.

PlanT is based on imitation learning with a compact object-level input representation. On the Longest6 benchmark for CARLA, PlanT outperforms all prior methods (matching the driving score of the expert) while being 5.3× faster than equivalent pixel-based planning baselines during inference. Combining PlanT with an off-the-shelf perception module provides a sensor-based driving system that is more than 10 points better in terms of driving score than the existing state of the art. Furthermore, we propose an evaluation protocol to quantify the ability of planners to identify relevant objects, providing insights regarding their decision-making. Our results indicate that PlanT can focus on the most relevant object in the scene, even when this object is geometrically distant.}

Off-policy RL algorithms show great sample efficiency but can be unstable to train and require effective exploration techniques for sparse reward environments. A simple yet effective approach to address these challenges is to train a population of policies and ensemble them in certain ways. In this work, a novel population based evolutionary training framework inspired by evolution strategies (ES) called Behavior-aware Evolutionary Learning (BEL) is proposed. The main idea is to train a population of behaviorally diverse policies in parallel and conduct selection with simple linear recombination. BEL consists of two mechanisms called behavior-regularized perturbation (BRP) and behavior-targeted training (BTT) to accomplish stable and fine control of the population behavior divergence. Experimental studies showed that BEL not only has superior sample efficiency and stability compared to existing methods, but can also produce diverse agents in sparse reward environments. Due to the parallel implementation, BEL also exhibits relatively good computation efficiency, making it a practical and competitive method to train policies for real-world robots.}

We present a system, LM-Nav, for robotic navigation that enjoys the benefits of training on unannotated large datasets of trajectories, while still providing a high-level interface to the user. Instead of utilizing a labeled instruction following dataset, we show that such a system can be constructed entirely out of pre-trained models for navigation (ViNG), image-language association (CLIP), and language modeling (GPT-3), without requiring any fine-tuning or language-annotated robot data. LM-Nav extracts landmarks names from an instruction, grounds them in the world via the image-language model, and then reaches them via the (vision-only) navigation model.

In addition, the distance metric in the latent space is learned to preserve the similarity between grasps across different robotic hands, where the similarity of grasps is defined according to contact regions of the robotic hands. This property enables our method to transfer grasps between different grippers including a human hand, and grasp transfer has the potential to share grasping skills between robots and enable robots to learn grasping skills from humans.

In particular, the end-effector frame and the target-part frame achieve higher training efficiency than the commonly used world frame and robot-base frame in many tasks, intuitively because they provide helpful alignments among point clouds across time steps and thus can simplify visual module learning. Moreover, the well-performing frames vary across tasks, and some tasks may benefit from multiple frame candidates. We thus propose FrameMiners to adaptively select candidate frames and fuse their merits in a task-agnostic manner. Experimentally, FrameMiners achieves on-par or significantly higher performance than the best single-frame version on five fully physical manipulation tasks adapted from ManiSkill and OCRTOC.

The temporal photometric consistency enables self-supervised depth estimation without labels, further facilitating its application. However, most existing methods predict the depth solely based on each monocular image and ignore the correlations among multiple surrounding cameras, which are typically available for modern self-driving vehicles. In this paper, we propose a SurroundDepth method to incorporate the information from multiple surrounding views to predict depth maps across cameras. Specifically, we employ a joint network to process all the surrounding views and propose a cross-view transformer to effectively fuse the information from multiple views. We apply cross-view self-attention to efficiently enable the global interactions between multi-camera feature maps. Different from self-supervised monocular depth estimation, we are able to predict real-world scales given multi-camera extrinsic matrices. To achieve this goal, we adopt two-frame structure-from-motion to extract scale-aware pseudo depths to pretrain the models. Further, instead of predicting the ego-motion of each individual camera, we estimate a universal ego-motion of the vehicle and transfer it to each view to achieve multi-view consistency. In experiments, our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the challenging multi-camera depth estimation datasets DDAD and nuScenes. }

In this work, we present the new problem of optimizing the positioning of lidar lines to find the most effective configuration for the depth completion task. We propose a solution to reduce the number of lines while retaining the up-to-the-mark quality of depth completion. Our method consists of two components, (1) line selection based on the marginal contribution of a line computed via the Shapley value and (2) incorporating line position spread to take into account its need to arrive at image-wide depth completion. Spatially-aware Shapley values (SaS) succeed in selecting line subsets that yield a depth accuracy comparable to the full lidar input while using just half of the lines.}

The complex initial configuration and terrible material properties of plastic bags pose challenges to reliable perception and planning. Directly knotting it from random initial states is difficult. To tackle this problem, we propose Iterative Interactive Modeling (IIM) to first adjust the plastic bag to a standing pose with imitation learning to establish a high-confidence keypoint skeleton model, then perform a set of learned motion primitives to knot it. We leverage spatial action maps to accomplish the iterative pick-and-place action and a graph convolutional network to evaluate the adjusted pose during the IIM process. In experiments, we achieve an 85.0\% success rate in knotting 4 different plastic bags, including one with no demonstration.}

We frame this problem from the perspective of learning a suitable visual object representation that allows us to distinguish the desired object category from others. Our proposed approach integrates human supervision into the representation learning process by combining contrastive learning with an additional loss function that brings the representations of human examples close to each other in the latent space. Our experiments show that our proposed method performs better than self-supervised and fully supervised learning methods in offline evaluations and can also be used in real-time by a robot in a simplified recycling domain, where recycling streams contain a variety of objects.}

To be viable for safety-critical applications, like autonomous vehicles, neural networks must accurately estimate their epistemic or model uncertainty, achieving a level of system self-awareness. Techniques for epistemic uncertainty quantification often require OOD data during training or multiple neural network forward passes during inference. These approaches may not be suitable for real-time performance on high-dimensional inputs. Furthermore, existing methods lack interpretability of the estimated uncertainty, which limits their usefulness both to engineers for further system development and to downstream modules in the autonomy stack. We propose the use of evidential deep learning to estimate the epistemic uncertainty over a low-dimensional, interpretable latent space in a trajectory prediction setting. We introduce an interpretable paradigm for trajectory prediction that distributes the uncertainty among the semantic concepts: past agent behavior, road structure, and social context. We validate our approach on real-world autonomous driving data, demonstrating superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines.}

Sensor simulation involves modeling traffic participants, such as vehicles, with high-quality appearance and articulated geometry, and rendering them in real-time. The self-driving industry has employed artists to build these assets. However, this is expensive, slow, and may not reflect reality. Instead, reconstructing assets automatically from sensor data collected in the wild would provide a better path to generating a diverse and large set that provides good real-world coverage. However, current reconstruction approaches struggle on in-the-wild sensor data, due to its sparsity and noise. To tackle these issues, we present CADSim which combines part-aware object-class priors via a small set of CAD models with differentiable rendering to automatically reconstruct vehicle geometry, including articulated wheels, with high-quality appearance. Our experiments show our approach recovers more accurate shape from sparse data compared to existing approaches. Importantly, it also trains and renders efficiently.

Once the goal is discovered, the agent must accurately calibrate the last-mile of navigation to the goal. As with any robust system, switches between exploratory goal discovery and exploitative last-mile navigation enable better recovery from errors. Following these intuitive guide rails, we propose SLING to improve the performance of existing image-goal navigation systems. Entirely complementing prior methods, we focus on last-mile navigation and leverage the underlying geometric structure of the problem with neural descriptors. With simple but effective switches, we can easily connect SLING with heuristic, reinforcement learning, and neural modular policies. On a standardized image-goal navigation benchmark (Hahn et al. 2021), we improve performance across policies, scenes, and episode complexity, raising the state-of-the-art from 45\% to 55\% success rate.

These constraints make manipulation difficult by reducing grasp accessibility, so robots need to use non-prehensile strategies that leverage object-environment contacts to perform manipulation tasks. To tackle the challenge of planning and controlling contact-rich behaviors in such settings, this work uses Hybrid Force-Velocity Controllers (HFVCs) as the skill representation and plans skill sequences with learned preconditions. While HFVCs naturally enable robust and compliant contact-rich behaviors, solvers that synthesize them have traditionally relied on precise object models and closed-loop feedback on object pose, which are difficult to obtain in constrained environments due to occlusions. We first relax HFVCs' need for precise models and feedback with our HFVC synthesis framework, then learn a point-cloud-based precondition function to classify where HFVC executions will still be successful despite modeling inaccuracies. Finally, we use the learned precondition in a search-based task planner to complete contact-rich manipulation tasks in a shelf domain. Our method achieves a task success rate of $73.2\%$, outperforming the $51.5\%$ achieved by a baseline without the learned precondition. While the precondition function is trained in simulation, it can also transfer to a real-world setup without further fine-tuning.

This allows us to transfer demonstrations across environments (e.g. real-world to simulated kitchen) and agent embodiments (e.g. bimanual human demonstration to robotic arm). 
We evaluate on three challenging cross-domain learning problems and match the performance of demonstration-accelerated RL approaches that require in-domain demonstrations. In a simulated kitchen environment, our approach learns long-horizon robot manipulation tasks, using less than 3 minutes of human video demonstrations from a real-world kitchen.

The contributions of this work are threefold. First, we present a 6D pose refiner based on a render&compare strategy which can be applied to novel objects. The shape and coordinate system of the novel object are provided as inputs to the network by rendering multiple synthetic views of the object's CAD model. Second, we introduce a novel approach for coarse pose estimation which leverages a network trained to classify whether the pose error between a synthetic rendering and an observed image of the same object can be corrected by the refiner. Third, we introduce a large-scale synthetic dataset of photorealistic images of thousands of objects with diverse visual and shape properties and show that this diversity is crucial to obtain good generalization performance on novel objects. We train our approach on this large synthetic dataset and apply it without retraining to hundreds of novel objects in real images from several pose estimation benchmarks. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ModelNet and YCB-Video datasets.

On the other hand, the lack of interpretability in learning models also hampers the safety with unverifiable failure causes. In this paper, we propose a safety-enhanced autonomous driving framework, named Interpretable Sensor Fusion Transformer (InterFuser), to fully process and fuse information from multi-modal multi-view sensors for achieving comprehensive scene understanding and adversarial event detection. Besides, intermediate interpretable features are generated from our framework, which provide more semantics and are exploited to better constrain actions to be within the safe sets.

We propose two novel learning algorithms based on this framework for learning from human evaluative feedback and from preference.

Slip is a major cause of failure in many robotic grasping and manipulation tasks. Existing works use increased gripping forces to avoid/control slip. However, this may not be feasible, e.g., because (i) the robot cannot increase the gripping force-- the max gripping force has already applied or (ii) an increased force yields a damaged grasped object, such as soft fruit. Moreover, the robot fixes the gripping force when it forms a stable grasp on the surface of an object, and changing the gripping force during manipulative movements in real-time may not be feasible, e.g., with the Franka robot. Hence, controlling the slip by changing gripping forces is not an effective control policy in many settings. We propose a novel control approach to slip avoidance including a learned action-conditioned slip predictor and a constrained optimizer avoiding an expected slip given the desired robot actions. We show the effectiveness of this receding horizon controller in a series of test cases in real robot experimentation. Our experimental results show our proposed data-driven predictive controller can control slip for objects unseen in training.

In this work, we propose Dual Meta Imitation Learning (DMIL), a hierarchical meta imitation learning method where the high-level network and sub-skills are iteratively meta-learned with model-agnostic meta-learning. DMIL uses the likelihood of state-action pairs from each sub-skill as the supervision for the high-level network adaptation and uses the adapted high-level network to determine different data set for each sub-skill adaptation. We theoretically prove the convergence of the iterative training process of DMIL and establish the connection between DMIL and Expectation-Maximization algorithm.

Unlike the conventional fine-tuning approach that updates the whole encoder, our main idea is to reduce the amount of tunable parameters that can precisely account for the target domain-specific motion style. To this end, we introduce two components that exploit our prior knowledge of motion style shifts: (i) a low-rank motion style adapter that projects and adjusts the style features at a low-dimensional bottleneck; and (ii) a modular adapter strategy that disentangles the features of scene context and motion history to facilitate a fine-grained choice of adaptation layers.

PerAct encodes language goals and RGB-D voxel observations with a Perceiver Transformer, and outputs discretized actions by “detecting the next best voxel action”. Unlike frameworks that operate on 2D images, the voxelized 3D observation and action space provides a strong structural prior for efficiently learning 6-DoF actions.

However, today’s methods to train robust perception models are largely task-agnostic – they augment a dataset using random image transformations or adversarial examples targeted at the vision model in isolation. As such, they often introduce pixel perturbations that are ultimately benign for control. In contrast to prior work that synthesizes adversarial examples for single-step vision tasks, our key contribution is to synthesize adversarial scenarios tailored to multi-step, model-based control. To do so, we use differentiable MPC methods to calculate the sensitivity of a model-based controller to errors in state estimation. We show that re-training vision models on these adversarial datasets improves control performance on OoD test scenarios by up to 36.2\% compared to standard task-agnostic data augmentation. We demonstrate our method on examples of robotic navigation, manipulation in RoboSuite, and control of an autonomous air vehicle.}

However, the diversity of scenarios and efficiency of generation methods are heavily restricted by the rareness and structure of safety-critical scenarios. Therefore, existing generative models that only estimate distributions from observational data are not satisfying to solve this problem. In this paper, we integrate causality as a prior into the scenario generation and propose a flow-based generative framework, Causal Autoregressive Flow (CausalAF). CausalAF encourages the generative model to uncover and follow the causal relationship among generated objects via novel causal masking operations instead of searching the sample only from observational data. By learning the cause-and-effect mechanism of how the generated scenario causes risk situations rather than just learning correlations from data, CausalAF significantly improves learning efficiency. Extensive experiments on three heterogeneous traffic scenarios illustrate that CausalAF requires much fewer optimization resources to effectively generate safety-critical scenarios. We also show that using generated scenarios as additional training samples empirically improves the robustness of autonomous driving algorithms.}

Each curriculum module is instantiated as a neural network and is responsible for generating a particular curriculum. In order to coordinate those potentially conflicting modules in unified parameter space, we propose a multi-task hyper-net learning framework that uses a single hyper-net to parameterize all those curriculum modules. We evaluate our method on a series of robotic manipulation tasks and demonstrate its superiority over other state-of-the-art ACL methods in terms of sample efficiency and final performance.}

We conduct a systematic large-scale evaluation of this hypothesis on the problem of visual navigation -- in the real world, and on 2 different simulators (Habitat and iGibson) using 3 different robots (A1, AlienGo, Spot). Our results show that, contrary to expectation, adding fidelity does not help with learning; performance is poor due to slow simulation speed (preventing large-scale learning) and overfitting to inaccuracies in simulation physics.

Recently, deep learning based methods dominate the field. State-of-the-art (SOTA) methods usually follow an encoder-decoder paradigm. Specifically, the encoder is responsible for extracting information from agents' history states and HD-Map and providing a representation vector for each agent. Taking these vectors as input, the decoder predicts multi-step future positions for each agent, which is usually accomplished by a single multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to directly output a Tx2 tensor. Though models with adoptation of MLP decoder have dominated the leaderboard of multiple datasets, `the elephant in the room is that the temporal correlation among future time-steps is ignored since there is no direct relation among output neurons of a MLP. In this work, we examine this design choice and investigate several ways to apply the temporal inductive bias into the generation of future trajectories on top of a SOTA encoder. We find that simply using autoregressive RNN to generate future positions would lead to significant performance drop even with techniques such as history highway and teacher forcing. Instead, taking scratch trajectories generated by MLP as input, an additional refinement module based on structures with temporal prior such as RNN or 1D-CNN could remarkably boost the accuracy. Furthermore, we examine several objective functions to  emphasize the temporal priors. By the combination of aforementioned techniques to introduce the temporal prior, we improve the top-ranked method's performance by a large margin and achieve SOTA result on the Waymo Open Motion Challenge.}

Being able to eat independently with friends and family is considered one of the most memorable and important activities for people with mobility limitations. While existing robotic systems for feeding people with mobility limitations focus on solitary dining, commensality, the act of eating together, is often the practice of choice. Sharing meals with others introduces the problem of socially appropriate bite timing for a robot, i.e. the appropriate timing for the robot to feed without disrupting the social dynamics of a shared meal. Our key insight is that bite timing strategies that take into account the delicate balance of social cues can lead to seamless interactions during robot-assisted feeding in a social dining scenario. We approach this problem by collecting a Human-Human Commensality Dataset (HHCD) containing 30 groups of three people eating together. We use this dataset to analyze human-human commensality behaviors and develop bite timing prediction models in social dining scenarios. We also transfer these models to human-robot commensality scenarios. Our user studies show that prediction improves when our algorithm uses multimodal social signaling cues between diners to model bite timing.

In multi-agent navigation problems, the optimal actions depend heavily on the agents' density. Their interaction patterns grow exponentially with respect to such density, making it hard for learning-based methods to generalize. We propose to switch the learning objectives from predicting the optimal actions to predicting sets of admissible actions, which we call control admissibility models (CAMs), such that they can be easily composed and used for online inference for an arbitrary number of agents. We design CAMs using graph neural networks and develop training methods that optimize the CAMs in the standard model-free setting, with the additional benefit of eliminating the need for reward engineering typically required to balance collision avoidance and goal-reaching requirements. We evaluate the proposed approach in multi-agent navigation environments. We show that the CAM models can be trained in environments with only a few agents and be easily composed for deployment in dense environments with hundreds of agents, achieving better performance than state-of-the-art methods. }

In an MASD system, AVs not only navigate themselves to pursue their own goals, but also interact with each other to prevent congestion or collision, especially in scenarios like intersection or lane merging. Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) provides an appealing alternative to generate safe and efficient actions for multiple AVs. However, current MARL methods are limited to describe scenarios where agents interact in either a cooperative of competitive fashion within one episode. Ordinarily, the agents' objectives are defined with a global or team reward function, which fail to deal with the dynamic social preferences (SPs) and mixed motives like human drivers in traffic interactions. To this end, we propose a novel MARL method called Socially-Attentive Policy Optimization (SAPO), which incorporates: (a) a self-attention module to select the most interactive traffic participant for each AV, and (b) a social-aware integration mechanism to integrate objectives of interacting AVs by estimating the dynamic social preferences from their observations. SAPO solves the problem of how to improve the safety and efficiency of MASD systems, by enabling AVs to learn socially-compatible behaviors. Simulation experiments show that SAPO can successfully capture and utilize the variation of the SPs of AVs to achieve superior performance, compared with baselines in MASD scenarios.}

In this work, we introduce Reciprocal MIND MELD, a framework in which the robot learns the way in which a demonstrator is suboptimal and utilizes this information to provide feedback to the demonstrator to improve upon their demonstrations. We additionally develop an Embedding Predictor Network which learns to predict the demonstrator’s suboptimality online without the need for optimal labels. In a series of human-subject experiments in a driving simulator domain, we demonstrate that robotic feedback can effectively improve human demonstrations in two dimensions of suboptimality (p < .001) and that robotic feedback translates into better learning outcomes for a robotic agent on novel tasks (p = .045).}

M$\pi$Nets are trained on over 3 million motion planning problems in more than 500,000 environments. Our experiments show that M$\pi$Nets are significantly faster than global planners while exhibiting the reactivity needed to deal with dynamic scenes.

Ideally, these fleets should upload all their data, especially from rare operating contexts, in order to train robust ML models. However, this is infeasible due to prohibitive network bandwidth and data labeling costs. Instead, we propose a cooperative data sampling strategy where geo-distributed AVs collaborate to collect a diverse ML training dataset in the cloud. Since the AVs have a shared objective but minimal information about each other's local data distribution and perception model, we can naturally cast cooperative data collection as an $N$-player mathematical game. We show that our cooperative sampling strategy uses minimal information to converge to a centralized oracle policy with complete information about all AVs. Moreover, we theoretically characterize the performance benefits of our game-theoretic strategy compared to greedy sampling. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate that our method outperforms standard benchmarks by up to $21.9\%$ on 4 perception datasets, including for autonomous driving in adverse weather conditions. Crucially, our experimental results on real-world datasets closely align with our theoretical guarantees.}

Although recent literature has made significant progress on BEV map understanding, they are all based on single-agent camera-based systems. These solutions sometimes have difficulty handling occlusions or detecting distant objects in complex traffic scenes. Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication technologies have enabled autonomous vehicles to share sensing information, dramatically improving the perception performance and range compared to single-agent systems. In this paper, we propose CoBEVT, the first generic multi-agent multi-camera perception framework that can cooperatively generate BEV map predictions. To efficiently fuse camera features from multi-view and multi-agent data in an underlying Transformer architecture, we design a fused axial attention module (FAX), which captures sparsely local and global spatial interactions across views and agents. The extensive experiments on the V2V perception dataset, OPV2V, demonstrate that CoBEVT achieves state-of-the-art performance for cooperative BEV semantic segmentation. Moreover, CoBEVT is shown to be generalizable to other tasks, including 1) BEV segmentation with single-agent multi-camera and 2) 3D object detection with multi-agent LiDAR systems, achieving state-of-the-art performance with real-time inference speed.

Experiments show that this decomposition works well in challenging settings requiring the robot to begin with an initially cluttered scene, selecting only the objects that need to be rearranged while discarding others, and dealing with cases where the goal location for an object is already occupied – making it the first system to address all these concurrently in a purely image-based setting. We also achieve an $\sim$ 8\% improvement in task success rate over the previously best reported result that handles both translation and orientation in less restrictive (un-cluttered, non-selective) settings.

In this paper, we study out-of-dynamics imitation learning (OOD-IL), which relaxes the assumption to that the demonstrator and the imitator have the same state spaces but could have different action spaces and dynamics. OOD-IL enables imitation learning to utilize demonstrations from a wide range of demonstrators but introduces a new challenge: some demonstrations cannot be achieved by the imitator due to the different dynamics. Prior works try to filter out such demonstrations by feasibility measurements, but ignore the fact that the demonstrations exhibit a multimodal distribution since the different demonstrators may take different policies in different dynamics. We develop a better transferability measurement to tackle this newly-emerged challenge. We firstly design a novel sequence-based contrastive clustering algorithm to cluster demonstrations from the same mode to avoid the mutual interference of demonstrations from different modes, and then learn the transferability of each demonstration with an adversarial-learning based algorithm in each cluster. Experiment results on several MuJoCo environments, a driving environment, and a simulated robot environment show that the proposed transferability measurement more accurately finds and down-weights non-transferable demonstrations and outperforms prior works on the final imitation learning performance.

To overcome this challenge, we propose \textit{TrackletMapper}, a framework for annotating ground surface types such as sidewalks, roads, and street crossings from object tracklets without requiring human-annotated data. To this end, we project the robot ego-trajectory and the paths of other traffic participants into the ego-view camera images, creating sparse semantic annotations for multiple types of ground surfaces from which a ground segmentation model can be trained. We further show that the model can be self-distilled for additional performance benefits by aggregating a ground surface map and projecting it into the camera images, creating a denser set of training annotations compared to the sparse tracklet annotations. We qualitatively and quantitatively attest our findings on a novel large-scale dataset for mobile robots operating in pedestrian areas.

It is a fast and compact model for onboard deployment. Specifically, we embed LiDAR points into pixel-aligned multi-modal features, which we pass through a sequence of Transformer refinement stages. Quantitative experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset support these claims, where we achieve state-of-the-art results on the task of 3D pose estimation.}

The proposed Laplace-approximation approach can easily convert a deterministic 3D object detector into a Bayesian neural network capable of estimating epistemic uncertainty. The experiment results on the KITTI dataset empirically validate the effectiveness of our proposed methods, and demonstrate that Laplace approximation performs better uncertainty quality than Monte-Carlo Dropout, DeepEnsembles, and deterministic models.}

Learning from demonstration (LfD) is an effective way to eliminate this problem, which leverages collected expert data to aid online learning. Prior works often assume that the learning agent and the expert aim to accomplish the same task, which requires collecting new data for every new task. In this paper, we consider the case where the target task is mismatched from but similar with that of the expert. Such setting can be challenging and we found existing LfD methods may encounter a phenomenon called reward signal backward propagation blockages so that the agent cannot be effectively guided by the demonstrations from mismatched task. We propose conservative reward shaping from demonstration (CRSfD), which shapes the sparse rewards using estimated expert value function. To accelerate learning processes, CRSfD guides the agent to conservatively explore around demonstrations. Experimental results of robot manipulation tasks show that our approach outperforms baseline LfD methods when transferring demonstrations collected in a single task to other different but similar tasks.}

A common claim is that deep networks are incapable of accurately modeling rigid-body dynamics without explicit modules for handling contacts, due to the continuous nature of how deep networks are parameterized. Here we investigate this claim with experiments on established real and simulated datasets and show that general-purpose graph network simulators, with no contact-specific assumptions, can learn and predict contact discontinuities. Furthermore, contact dynamics learned by graph network simulators capture real-world cube tossing trajectories more accurately than highly engineered robotics simulators, even when provided with only 8 -- 16 trajectories. Overall, this suggests that rigid-body dynamics do not pose a fundamental challenge for deep networks with the appropriate general architecture and parameterization.  Instead, our work opens new directions for considering when deep learning-based models might be preferable to traditional simulation environments for accurately modeling real-world contact dynamics.}

Typically, other objects' relevant state features are not directly observable, and must instead be inferred from observations. Particle filtering can perform such inference given approximate transition and observation models. However, these models are often unknown a priori, yielding a difficult parameter estimation problem since observations jointly carry transition and observation noise. In this work, we consider learning maximum-likelihood parameters using particle methods. Recent methods addressing this problem typically differentiate through time in a particle filter, which requires workarounds to the non-differentiable resampling step, that yield biased or high variance gradient estimates. By contrast, we exploit Fisher's identity to obtain a particle-based approximation of the score function (the gradient of the log likelihood) that yields a low variance estimate while only requiring stepwise differentiation through the transition and observation models. We apply our method to real data collected from autonomous vehicles (AVs) and show that it learns better models than existing techniques and is more stable in training, yielding an effective smoother for tracking the trajectories of vehicles around an AV.}

Thus, we propose modelling unknown dynamics using Gaussian processes, which provide a principled Bayesian framework for incorporating online observations made by the robot, and using them to predict the dynamics in unexplored areas. We then formulate the problem of mission planning in Markov decision processes under Gaussian process predictions as Bayesian model-based reinforcement learning. This allows us to employ solution techniques that plan more efficiently than previous Gaussian process planning methods are able to. We empirically evaluate the benefits of our formulation in an underwater autonomous vehicle navigation task and robot mission planning in a realistic simulation of a nuclear environment.}

To accomplish this, the learning model needs to encode a stable vector field that resembles the desired motion dynamics. This is challenging as the robot state does not evolve on a Euclidean space, and therefore the stability guarantees and vector field encoding need to account for the geometry arising from, for example, the orientation representation. To tackle this problem, we propose learning Riemannian stable dynamical systems (RSDS) from demonstrations, allowing us to account for different geometric constraints resulting from the dynamical system state representation. Our approach provides Lyapunov-stability guarantees on Riemannian manifolds that are enforced on the desired motion dynamics via diffeomorphisms built on neural manifold ODEs. We show that our Riemannian approach makes it possible to learn stable dynamical systems displaying complicated vector fields on both illustrative examples and real-world manipulation tasks, where Euclidean approximations fail.}

We created a Unity-based platform for simulating warehouse environments where human-robot teammates work on collaborative delivery tasks. We have collected a dataset that includes demonstrations of visualizing robots' current and planned behaviors. Our results from experiments with real human participants show that, compared with competitive baselines from the literature, our learned visualization strategies significantly increase the efficiency of human-robot teams in delivery tasks, while reducing the distraction level of human users.}

ERL offers several distinct benefits in comparison to step-based RL. It generates smooth control trajectories, can handle non-Markovian reward definitions, and the resulting exploration in parameter space is well suited for solving sparse reward settings. Yet, the high dimensionality of the movement primitive parameters has so far hampered the effective use of deep RL methods. In this paper, we present a new algorithm for deep ERL. It is based on differentiable trust region layers, a successful on-policy deep RL algorithm. These layers allow us to specify trust regions for the policy update that are solved exactly for each state using convex optimization, which enables policies learning with the high precision required for the ERL. We compare our ERL algorithm to state-of-the-art step-based algorithms in many complex simulated robotic control tasks. In doing so, we investigate different reward formulations - dense, sparse, and non-Markovian. While step-based algorithms perform well only on dense rewards, ERL performs favorably on sparse and non-Markovian rewards. Moreover, our results show that the sparse and the non-Markovian rewards are also often better suited to define the desired behavior, allowing us to obtain considerably higher quality policies compared to step-based RL.}

In this paper, we propose the Discriminator-guided Model-based offline Imitation Learning (DMIL) framework, which introduces a discriminator to simultaneously distinguish the dynamics correctness and sub-optimality of model rollout data against real expert demonstrations. DMIL adopts a novel cooperative-yet-adversarial learning strategy, which uses the discriminator to guide and couple the learning process of the policy and dynamics model, resulting in improved model performance and robustness. Our framework can also be extended to the case when demonstrations contain a large proportion of suboptimal data. Experimental results show that DMIL and its extension achieve superior performance and robustness compared to state-of-the-art offline IL methods under small datasets.}

Our key insight is that moving objects can be reliably detected from point cloud sequences without the need for human-labeled 3D bounding boxes. In a single LiDAR frame extracted from a sequence, the set of moving objects provides sufficient supervision for single-frame object detection. By designing appropriate pretext tasks, we learn point cloud features that generalize to both moving and static unseen objects. We apply these features to object detection, achieving strong performance on self-supervised representation learning and unsupervised object detection tasks. }

While being fully interpretable, they rely on manual interference and empirical parameter tuning. On the other hand, learning-based approaches allow for end-to-end training but require a large number of training data to learn millions of parameters. However, the non-interpretable and heavy models hinder the generalization ability. In this paper, we propose a fully differentiable, and interpretable, bird-eye-view (BEV) based VIO model for robots with local planar motion that can be trained without deep neural networks. Specifically, we first adopt Unscented Kalman Filter as a differentiable layer to predict the pitch and roll, where the covariance matrices of noise are learned to filter out the noise of the IMU raw data.  Second, the refined pitch and roll are adopted to retrieve a gravity-aligned BEV image of each frame using differentiable camera projection. Finally, a differentiable pose estimator is utilized to estimate the remaining 3 DoF poses between the BEV frames: leading to a 5 DoF pose estimation. Our method allows for learning the covariance matrices end-to-end supervised by the pose estimation loss, demonstrating superior performance to empirical baselines. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our simple approach is competitive with state-of-the-art methods and generalizes well on unseen scenes.}

An important challenge in robot design automation is the large and complex design search space which grows exponentially with the number of components, making optimization difficult and sample inefficient. In this work, we present Grammar-guided Latent Space Optimization (GLSO), a framework that transforms design automation into a low-dimensional continuous optimization problem by training a graph variational autoencoder (VAE) to learn a mapping between the graph-structured design space and a continuous latent space. This transformation allows optimization to be conducted in a continuous latent space, where sample efficiency can be significantly boosted by applying algorithms such as Bayesian Optimization. GLSO guides training of the VAE using graph grammar rules and robot world space features, such that the learned latent space focus on valid robots and is easier for the optimization algorithm to explore. Importantly, the trained VAE can be reused to search for designs specialized to multiple different tasks without retraining. We evaluate GLSO by designing robots for a set of locomotion tasks in simulation, and demonstrate that our method outperforms related state-of-the-art robot design automation methods.}

In this work, we develop a structured approach to sample-efficient learning of dexterous manipulation skills from demonstrations by leveraging recent advances in robot motion generation and control. Specifically, our policy structure is induced by Geometric Fabrics - a recent framework that generalizes classical mechanical systems to allow for flexible design of expressive robot motions. To avoid the cumbersome manual design required by existing motion generators, we introduce Neural Geometric Fabric (NGF) - a framework that learns Geometric Fabric-based policies from data. NGF policies are provably stable and capable of encoding speed-invariant geometries of complex motions in multiple task spaces simultaneously. We demonstrate that NGFs can learn to perform a variety of dexterous manipulation tasks on a 23-DoF hand-arm physical robotic platform purely from demonstrations. Results from comprehensive comparative and ablative experiments show that NGF's structure and action spaces help learn acceleration-based policies that consistently outperform state-of-the-art baselines like Riemannian Motion Policies (RMPs), and other commonly used networks, such as feed-forward and recurrent neural networks. More importantly, we demonstrate that NGFs do not rely on often-used and expertly-designed operational-space controllers, promoting an advancement towards efficiently learning safe, stable, and high-dimensional controllers.}

Instead, we combine a mixture of movement primitives with a distribution matching objective to learn versatile behaviors that match the expert’s behavior and versatility. To facilitate generalization to novel task configurations, we do not directly match the agent’s and expert’s trajectory distributions but rather work with concise geometric descriptors which generalize well to unseen task configurations. We empirically validate our method on various robot tasks using versatile human demonstrations and compare to imitation learning algorithms in a state-action setting as well as a trajectory-based setting. We find that the geometric descriptors greatly help in generalizing to new task configurations and that combining them with our distribution-matching objective is crucial for representing and reproducing versatile behavior.}

To handle the intra-category variation, we adopt a semantic primitive representation that encodes diverse shapes into a unified latent space, which is the key to establish reliable correspondences between observed point clouds and estimated shapes. Then, by using a SIM(3)-invariant shape descriptor, we gracefully decouple the shape and pose of an object, thus supporting latent shape optimization of target objects in arbitrary poses. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method achieves SOTA pose estimation performance and better generalization in the real-world dataset.

Moreover, manually designing reward functions for every single desired skill is prohibitive. Prior works targeted these challenges by learning goal-conditioned policies from offline datasets without manually specified rewards, through hindsight relabeling. These methods suffer from the issue of sparsity of rewards, and fail at long-horizon tasks. In this work, we propose a novel self-supervised learning phase on the pre-collected dataset to understand the structure and the dynamics of the model, and shape a dense reward function for learning policies offline. We evaluate our method on three continuous control tasks, and show that our model significantly outperforms existing approaches, especially on tasks that involve long-term planning.}

One way to address this challenge is with unstructured human play, where humans operate freely in an environment to reach unspecified goals. Play is a simple and cheap method for collecting diverse user demonstrations with broad state and goal coverage over an environment. Due to this diverse coverage, existing approaches for learning from play are more robust to online policy deviations from the offline data distribution. However, these methods often struggle to learn under scene variation and on challenging manipulation primitives, due in part to improperly associating complex behaviors to the scene changes they induce. Our insight is that an object-centric view of play data can help link human behaviors and the resulting changes in the environment, and thus improve multi-task policy learning. In this work, we construct a latent space to model object \textit{affordances} -- properties of an object that define its uses -- in the environment, and then learn a policy to achieve the desired affordances. By modeling and predicting the desired affordance across variable horizon tasks, our method, Predicting Latent Affordances Through Object-Centric Play (PLATO), outperforms existing methods on complex manipulation tasks in both 2D and 3D object manipulation simulation and real world environments for diverse types of interactions.

In this work, we present a method for achieving category-level pose estimation by inspection of just a single object from a desired category. We show that we can subsequently perform accurate pose estimation for unseen objects from an inspected category, and considerably outperform prior work by exploiting multi-view correspondences. We demonstrate that our method runs in real-time, enabling a robot manipulator to rearrange previously unseen objects faithfully in terms of placement and orientation. Finally, we showcase our method in a continual learning setting, with a robot able to determine whether objects belong to known categories, and if not, use active perception to produce a one-shot category representation for subsequent pose estimation}

In AIL, an artificial adversary's misclassification is used as a reward signal that is optimized by any standard Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm. Unlike most RL settings, the reward in AIL is $differentiable$ but current model-free RL algorithms do not make use of this property to train a policy. The reward is AIL is also $shaped$ since it comes from an adversary. We leverage the differentiability property of the shaped AIL reward function and formulate a class of Actor Residual Critic (ARC) RL algorithms. ARC algorithms draw a parallel to the standard Actor-Critic (AC) algorithms in RL literature and uses a residual critic, $C$ function (instead of the standard $Q$ function) to approximate only the discounted future return (excluding the immediate reward). ARC algorithms have similar convergence properties as the standard AC algorithms with the additional advantage that the gradient through the immediate reward is exact. For the discrete (tabular) case with finite states, actions, and known dynamics, we prove that policy iteration with $C$ function converges to an optimal policy. In the continuous case with function approximation and unknown dynamics, we experimentally show that ARC aided AIL outperforms standard AIL in simulated continuous-control and real robotic manipulation tasks. ARC algorithms are simple to implement and can be incorporated into any existing AIL implementation with an AC algorithm.}

As a result, the predicted trajectories are not necessarily consistent with each other, and often result in unrealistic trajectory overlaps. In contrast, we propose an end-to-end trainable model that learns directly the interaction between pairs of agents in a structured, graphical model formulation in order to generate consistent future trajectories.

Multi-task RL and meta-RL aim to improve sample efficiency by generalizing over a distribution of related tasks. However, doing so is difficult in practice: In multi-task RL, state of the art methods often fail to outperform a degenerate solution that simply learns each task separately. Hypernetworks are a promising path forward since they replicate the separate policies of the degenerate solution while also allowing for generalization across tasks, and are applicable to meta-RL. However, evidence from supervised learning suggests hypernetwork performance is highly sensitive to the initialization. In this paper, we 1) show that hypernetwork initialization is also a critical factor in meta-RL, and that naive initializations yield poor performance; 2) propose a novel hypernetwork initialization scheme that matches or exceeds the performance of a state-of-the-art approach proposed for supervised settings, as well as being simpler and more general; and 3) use this method to show that hypernetworks can improve performance in meta-RL by evaluating on multiple simulated robotics benchmarks.}

We consider \emph{option templates}, which are specifications encoding a potential option that can be trained using reinforcement learning. We formulate expert intervention as allowing the agent to execute option templates  before learning an implementation. This enables them to use an option, before committing costly resources to learning it.

	abstract = {A robotic feeding system must be able to acquire a variety of foods. Prior bite acquisition works consider single-arm spoon scooping or fork skewering, which do not generalize to foods with complex geometries and deformabilities. For example, when acquiring a group of peas, skewering could smoosh the peas while scooping without a barrier could result in chasing the peas on the plate. In order to acquire foods with such diverse properties, we propose stabilizing food items during scooping using a second arm, for example, by pushing peas against the spoon with a flat surface to prevent dispersion. The addition of this second stabilizing arm can lead to a new set of challenges. Critically, these strategies should stabilize the food scene without interfering with the acquisition motion, which is especially difficult for easily breakable high-risk food items, such as tofu. These high-risk foods can break between the pusher and spoon during scooping, which can lead to food waste falling onto the plate or out of the workspace. We propose a general bimanual scooping primitive and an adaptive stabilization strategy that enables successful acquisition of a diverse set of food geometries and physical properties. Our approach, CARBS: Coordinated Acquisition with Reactive Bimanual Scooping, learns to stabilize without impeding task progress by identifying high-risk foods and robustly scooping them using closed-loop visual feedback. We find that CARBS is able to generalize across food shape, size, and deformability and is additionally able to manipulate multiple food items simultaneously. CARBS achieves 87.0\% success on scooping rigid foods, which is 25.8\% more successful than a single-arm baseline, and reduces food breakage by 16.2\% compared to an analytical baseline.

We present Bayesian Object Models (BOMs): generative (probabilistic) models that encode both the structural and kinodynamic attributes of an object. BOMs are implemented in the form of a differentiable probabilistic program that models latent scene structure, object dynamics, and observation models. This allows for efficient and automated Bayesian inference -- samples (object trajectories) drawn from the BOM are compared with a small set of real-world observations and used to compute a likelihood function. Our model comprises a differentiable tree structure sampler and a differentiable physics engine, enabling gradient computation through this likelihood function. This enables gradient-based Bayesian inference to efficiently update the distributional parameters of our model. BOMs outperform several recent approaches, including differentiable physics-based, gradient-free, and neural inference schemes. Further information at: https://bayesianobjects.github.io/}

Deep learning has offered a way to develop image-based orientation estimators; however, such estimators often require training on a large labeled dataset, which can be time-intensive to collect. In this work, we explore whether self-supervised learning from unlabeled data can be used to alleviate this issue.  Specifically, we assume access to estimates of the relative orientation between neighboring poses, such that can be obtained via a local alignment method. While self-supervised learning has been used successfully for translational object keypoints, in this work, we show that naively applying relative supervision to the rotational group $SO(3)$ will often fail to converge due to the non-convexity of the rotational space. To tackle this challenge, we propose a new algorithm for self-supervised orientation estimation which utilizes Modified Rodrigues Parameters to stereographically project the closed manifold of $SO(3)$ to the open manifold of $\mathbb{R}^{3}$, allowing the optimization to be done in an open Euclidean space. We empirically validate the benefits of the proposed algorithm for rotational averaging problem in two settings: (1) direct optimization on rotation parameters, and (2) optimization of parameters of a convolutional neural network that predicts object orientations from images. In both settings, we demonstrate that our proposed algorithm is able to converge to a consistent relative orientation frame much faster than algorithms that purely operate in the $SO(3)$ space.

Our predictive model is implemented using deep neural networks that map raw observations to future detection and pose trajectories and is learned entirely offline using a dataset of recorded observations (not ground-truth states). Once learned, our predictive model can be used for contingency planning over the potential existence, intentions, and positions of unobserved agents. We demonstrate the effectiveness of AVP on a set of autonomous driving environments inspired by real-world scenarios that require reasoning about the existence of other unobserved agents for safe and efficient driving.

Our framework maps high-dimension 3D observations such as point clouds into a set of latent vectors and plans over skill sequences on top of the latent set representation. We show that our method can effectively perform  challenging sequential deformable object manipulation tasks in the real world, which require combining multiple tool-use skills such as cutting with a knife, pushing with a pusher, and spreading dough with a roller.

However, in practice, real-world robotic RL typically requires time consuming data collection and frequent human intervention to reset the environment. Moreover, robotic policies learned with RL often fail when deployed beyond the carefully controlled setting in which they were learned. In this work, we study how these challenges of real-world robotic learning can all be tackled by effective utilization of diverse offline datasets collected from previously seen tasks. When faced with a new task, our system adapts previously learned skills to quickly learn to both perform the new task and return the environment to an initial state, effectively performing its own environment reset. Our empirical results demonstrate that incorporating prior data into robotic reinforcement learning enables autonomous learning, substantially improves sample-efficiency of learning, and enables better generalization.}

This is usually done with error-prone geometric operations (e.g., homography or back-projection from monocular depth estimation) or expensive direct dense mapping between image pixels and pixels in BEV (e.g., with MLP or attention). In this work, we present ‘LaRa’, an efficient encoder-decoder, transformer-based model for vehicle semantic segmentation from multiple cameras. Our approach uses a system of cross-attention to aggregate information over multiple sensors into a compact, yet rich, collection of latent representations. These latent representations, after being processed by a series of selfattention blocks, are then reprojected with a second cross-attention in the BEV space. We demonstrate that our model outperforms the best previous works using transformers on nuScenes. The code and trained models are available at https://github.com/valeoai/LaRa.},

In particular, we propose a method for partially observable reinforcement learning that uses a fully observable policy (which we call a \emph{state expert}) during training to improve performance. Based on Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), our agent balances performing actions similar to the state expert and getting high returns under partial observability. Our approach can leverage the fully-observable policy for exploration and parts of the domain that are fully observable while still being able to learn under partial observability. On six robotics domains, our method outperforms pure imitation, pure reinforcement learning, the sequential or parallel combination of both types, and a recent state-of-the-art method in the same setting. A successful policy transfer to a physical robot in a manipulation task from pixels shows our approach's practicality in learning interesting policies under partial observability.}

Our approach, called Performer-MPC, uses a learned cost function parameterized by vision context embeddings provided by Performers---a low-rank implicit-attention Transformer. We jointly train the cost function and construct the controller relying on it, effectively solving end-to-end the corresponding bi-level optimization problem. We show that the resulting policy improves standard MPC performance by leveraging a few expert demonstrations of the desired navigation behavior in different challenging real-world scenarios.

	abstract = {Sampling-based methods have become a cornerstone of contemporary approaches to Model Predictive Control (MPC), as they make no restrictions on the differentiability of the dynamics or cost function and are straightforward to parallelize. However, their efficacy is highly dependent on the quality of the sampling distribution itself, which is often assumed to be simple, like a Gaussian. This restriction can result in samples which are far from optimal, leading to poor performance. Recent work has explored improving the performance of MPC by sampling in a learned latent space of controls. However, these methods ultimately perform all MPC parameter updates and warm-starting between time steps in the control space. This requires us to rely on a number of heuristics for generating samples and updating the distribution and may lead to sub-optimal performance. Instead, we propose to carry out all operations in the latent space, allowing us to take full advantage of the learned distribution. Specifically, we frame the learning problem as bi-level optimization and show how to train the controller with backpropagation-through-time. By using a normalizing flow parameterization of the distribution, we can leverage its tractable density to avoid requiring differentiability of the dynamics and cost function. Finally, we evaluate the proposed approach on simulated robotics tasks and demonstrate its ability to surpass the performance of prior methods and scale better with a reduced number of samples.}

To mimic such capability, we propose Embodied Concept Learner (ECL) in an interactive 3D environment. Specifically, a robot agent can ground visual concepts, build semantic maps and plan actions to complete tasks by learning purely from human demonstrations and language instructions, without access to ground-truth semantic and depth supervision from simulations. ECL consists of: (i) an instruction parser that translates the natural languages into executable programs; (ii) an embodied concept learner that grounds visual concepts based on language descriptions; (iii) a map constructor that estimates depth and constructs semantic maps by leveraging the learned concepts; and (iv) a program executor with deterministic policies to execute each program. ECL has several appealing benefits thanks to its modularized design. Firstly, it enables the robotic agent to learn semantics and depth unsupervisedly acting like babies, e.g., ground concepts through active interaction and perceive depth by disparities when moving forward. Secondly, ECL is fully transparent and step-by-step interpretable in long-term planning. Thirdly, ECL could be beneficial for the embodied instruction following (EIF), outperforming previous works on the ALFRED benchmark when the semantic label is not provided. Also, the learned concept can be reused for other downstream tasks, such as reasoning of object states.}

NeRFs have become a popular choice for representing scenes due to their strong 3D prior. However, most NeRF approaches are trained on a single scene, representing the whole scene with a global model, making generalization to novel scenes, containing different numbers of objects, challenging. Instead, we present a compositional, object-centric auto-encoder framework that maps multiple views of the scene to a set of latent vectors representing each object separately. The latent vectors parameterize individual NeRFs from which the scene can be reconstructed. Based on those latent vectors, we train a graph neural network dynamics model in the latent space to achieve compositionality for dynamics prediction. A key feature of our approach is that the latent vectors are forced to encode 3D information through the NeRF decoder, which enables us to incorporate structural priors in learning the dynamics models, making long-term predictions more stable compared to several baselines. Simulated and real world experiments show that our method can model and learn the dynamics of compositional scenes including rigid and deformable objects.

LLMs planning in embodied environments need to consider not just what skills to do, but also how and when to do them - answers that change over time in response to the agent's own choices. In this work, we investigate to what extent LLMs used in such embodied contexts can reason over sources of feedback provided through natural language, without any additional training. We propose that by leveraging environment feedback, LLMs are able to form an inner monologue that allows them to more richly process and plan in robotic control scenarios. We investigate a variety of sources of feedback, such as success detection, scene description, and human interaction. We find that closed-loop language feedback significantly improves high level instruction completion on three domains, including simulated and real table top rearrangement tasks and long-horizon mobile manipulation tasks in a kitchen environment in the real world.}

We conjecture that this relationship is a generalizable notion of a manipulation task that can transfer to new objects in the same category; examples include the relationship between the pose of a pan relative to an oven or the pose of a mug relative to a mug rack. We call this task-specific pose relationship “cross-pose” and provide a mathematical definition of this concept. We propose a vision-based system that learns to estimate the cross-pose between two objects for a given manipulation task using learned cross-object correspondences. The estimated cross-pose is then used to guide a downstream motion planner to manipulate the objects into the desired pose relationship (placing a pan into the oven or the mug onto the mug rack). We demonstrate our method’s capability to generalize to unseen objects, in some cases after training on only 10 demonstrations in the real world.

The implicit assumption here is that all video demonstrations show an optimal/sub-optimal way of performing the task. What if that is not true? What if one or more videos show a wrong way of executing the task? A task policy learned from such incorrect demonstrations can be potentially unsafe for robots and humans. It is therefore important to analyze the video demonstrations for correctness before handing them over to the policy learning algorithm. This is a challenging task, especially due to the very large state space. This paper proposes a framework to autonomously detect incorrect video demonstrations of sequential tasks consisting of several sub-tasks. We analyze the demonstration pool to identify video(s) for which task-features follow a ‘disruptive’ sequence. We analyze entropy to measure this disruption and – through solving a minmax problem – assign poor weights to incorrect videos. We evaluated the framework with two real-world video datasets: our custom-designed Tea-Making with a YuMi robot and the publicly available 50-Salads. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed framework in detecting incorrect video demonstrations even when they make up 40\% of the demonstration set. We also show that various state-of-the-art imitation learning algorithms learn a better policy when incorrect demonstrations are discarded from the training pool.}

As both paradigms have complementary strengths and weaknesses, we propose a novel hierarchical approach that combines the strengths of both methods to learn task-agnostic long-horizon policies from high-dimensional camera observations. Concretely, we combine a low-level policy that learns latent skills via imitation learning and a high-level policy learned from offline reinforcement learning for skill-chaining the latent behavior priors. Experiments in various simulated and real robot control tasks show that our formulation enables producing previously unseen combinations of skills to reach temporally extended goals by ``stitching'' together latent skills through goal chaining with an order-of-magnitude improvement in performance upon state-of-the-art baselines.

While training in simulation and deploying visual sim-to-real techniques has worked well for robot manipulation, deploying beyond controlled workspace viewpoints remains a challenge. In this paper, we address this challenge by presenting Sim2Seg, a re-imagining of RCAN that crosses the visual reality gap for off-road autonomous driving, without using any real-world data. This is done by learning to translate randomized simulation images into simulated segmentation and depth maps, subsequently enabling real-world images to also be translated. This allows us to train an end-to-end RL policy in simulation, and directly deploy in the real-world. Our approach, which can be trained in 48 hours on 1 GPU, can perform equally as well as a classical perception and control stack that took thousands of engineering hours over several months to build.

However, AVs must still detect rare classes to ensure safe operation. Moreover, semantic classes are often organized within a hierarchy, e.g., tail classes such as child and construction-worker are arguably subclasses of pedestrian. However, such hierarchical relationships are often ignored, which may lead to misleading estimates of performance and missed opportunities for algorithmic innovation. We address these challenges by formally studying the problem of Long-Tailed 3D Detection (LT3D), which evaluates on all classes, including those in-the-tail. We evaluate and innovate upon popular 3D detection codebases, such as CenterPoint and PointPillars, adapting them for LT3D. We develop hierarchical losses that promote feature sharing across common-vs-rare classes, as well as improved detection metrics that award partial credit to "reasonable" mistakes respecting the hierarchy (e.g., mistaking a child for an adult). Finally, we point out that fine-grained tail class accuracy is particularly improved via multimodal fusion of RGB images with LiDAR; simply put, small fine-grained classes are challenging to identify from sparse (lidar) geometry alone, suggesting that multimodal cues are crucial to long-tailed 3D detection. Our modifications improve accuracy by 5\% AP on average for all classes, and dramatically improve AP for rare classes (e.g., stroller AP improves from 3.6 to 31.6).}

Our abilities to predict the appearance and affordance of the scene from previously unobserved viewpoints aid us in performing manipulation tasks (e.g., 6-DoF kitting) with a level of ease that is currently out of reach for existing robot learning frameworks. In this work, we aim to build artificial systems that can analogously plan actions on top of imagined images. To this end, we introduce Mental Imagery for Robotic Affordances (MIRA), an action reasoning framework that optimizes actions with novel-view synthesis and affordance prediction in the loop. Given a set of 2D RGB images, MIRA builds a consistent 3D scene representation, through which we synthesize novel orthographic views amenable to pixel-wise affordances prediction for action optimization. We illustrate how this optimization process enables us to generalize to unseen out-of-plane rotations for 6-DoF robotic manipulation tasks given a limited number of demonstrations, paving the way toward machines that autonomously learn to understand the world around them for planning actions.}

IPP requires frequent online replanning as this belief is updated with every new measurement (i.e., adaptive IPP), while balancing short-term exploitation and longer-term exploration to avoid suboptimal, myopic behaviors. Encouraged by the recent developments in deep reinforcement learning, we introduce CAtNIPP, a fully reactive, neural approach to the adaptive IPP problem. CAtNIPP relies on self-attention for its powerful ability to capture dependencies in data at multiple spatial scales. Specifically, our agent learns to form a context of its belief over the entire domain, which it uses to sequence local movement decisions that optimize short- and longer-term search objectives. We experimentally demonstrate that CAtNIPP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art non-learning IPP solvers in terms of solution quality and computing time once trained, and present experimental results on hardware.}

Our method achieved an 86.7\% success over 120 real world grasping trials on 20 household objects, including unseen and challenging geometries.

Motivated by the need to improve safety of autonomous vehicles without compromising on their performance, we develop a probabilistic run-time monitor that detects when a "harmful" prediction failure occurs, i.e., a task-relevant failure detector. We achieve this by propagating trajectory prediction errors to the planning cost to reason about their impact on the AV. Furthermore, our detector comes equipped with performance measures on the false-positive and the false-negative rate and allows for data-free calibration.

While the ideal dataset for imitation learning is homogenous and low-variance - reflecting a single, optimal method for performing a task - natural human behavior has a great deal of heterogeneity, with several optimal ways to demonstrate a task. This multimodality is inconsequential to human users, with task variations manifesting as subconscious choices; for example, reaching down, then across to grasp an object, versus reaching across, then down. Yet, this mismatch presents a problem for interactive imitation learning, where sequences of users improve on a policy by iteratively collecting new, possibly conflicting demonstrations. To combat this problem of demonstrator incompatibility, this work designs an approach for 1) measuring the compatibility of a new demonstration given a base policy, and 2) actively eliciting more compatible demonstrations from new users. Across two simulation tasks requiring long-horizon, dexterous manipulation and a real-world ``food plating'' task with a Franka Emika Panda arm, we show that we can both identify incompatible demonstrations via post-hoc filtering, and apply our compatibility measure to actively elicit compatible demonstrations from new users, leading to improved task success rates across simulated and real environments.}

However, as they typically use photometric losses, their performance can degrade significantly when the assumptions these losses make (e.g. temporal illumination consistency, a static scene, and the absence of noise and occlusions) are violated. This limits their use for e.g. nighttime sequences, which tend to contain many point light sources (including on dynamic objects) and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in darker image regions. In this paper, we show how to use a combination of three techniques to allow the existing photometric losses to work for both day and nighttime images. First, we introduce a per-pixel neural intensity transformation to compensate for the light changes that occur between successive frames. Second, we predict a per-pixel residual flow map that we use to correct the reprojection correspondences induced by the estimated ego-motion and depth from the networks. And third, we denoise the training images to improve the robustness and accuracy of our approach. These changes allow us to train a single model for both day and nighttime images without needing separate encoders or extra feature networks like existing methods. We perform extensive experiments and ablation studies on the challenging Oxford RobotCar dataset to demonstrate the efficacy of our approach for both day and nighttime sequences.}

Moreover, a Scale Balanced Learning (SBL) loss and an Object Balanced Sampling (OBS) strategy are designed, where SBL enlarges the gradients of the samples whose scales are in low frequency by apriori weights while OBS captures more points on small-scale objects with the help of an auxiliary segmentation network. They alleviate the influence of the uneven distribution of grasp scales in training and inference respectively. In addition, Noisy-clean Mix (NcM) data augmentation is introduced to facilitate training, aiming to bridge the domain gap between synthetic and raw scenes in an efficient way by generating more data which mix them into single ones at instance-level. Extensive experiments are conducted on the GraspNet-1Billion benchmark and competitive results are reached with significant gains on small-scale cases.

Preference based RL algorithms seek to overcome these challenges by directly learning reward functions from human feedback. Unfortunately, prior work either requires an unreasonable number of queries implausible for any human to answer or overly restricts the class of reward functions to guarantee the elicitation of the most informative queries, resulting in models that are insufficiently expressive for realistic robotics tasks. Contrary to most works that focus on query selection to \emph{minimize} the amount of data required for learning reward functions, we take an opposite approach: \emph{expanding} the pool of available data by viewing human-in-the-loop RL through the more flexible lens of multi-task learning. Motivated by the success of meta-learning, we pre-train preference models on prior task data and quickly adapt them for new tasks using only a handful of queries. Empirically, we reduce the amount of online feedback needed to train manipulation policies in Meta-World by 20$\times$, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a real Franka Panda Robot. Moreover, this reduction in query-complexity allows us to train robot policies from actual human users.

In this paper, we focus on one particular aspect of this challenge: learning from offline data collected at different control frequencies. Across labs, the discretization of controllers, sampling rates of sensors, and demands of a task of interest may differ, giving rise to a mixture of frequencies in an aggregated dataset. We study how well offline reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms can accommodate data with a mixture of frequencies during training. We observe that the $Q$-value propagates at different rates for different discretizations, leading to a number of learning challenges for off-the-shelf offline RL algorithms. We present a simple yet effective solution that enforces consistency in the rate of  $Q$-value updates to stabilize learning. By scaling the value of $N$ in $N$-step returns with the discretization size, we effectively balance $Q$-value propagation, leading to more stable convergence. On three simulated robotic control problems, we empirically find that this simple approach significantly outperforms na\"ive mixing both terms of absolute performance and training stability, while also improving over using only the data from a single control frequency.}

We propose a framework that learns to predict the effects of a robot's actions on the contact between the tool and the environment given visuo-tactile perception. Key to our framework is a novel contact feature representation that consists of a binary contact value, the line of contact, and an end-effector wrench. We propose a method to learn the dynamics of these contact features from real world data that does not require predicting the geometry of the compliant tool.

Our approach (1) leverages learned strategies to construct policy mixtures for fast adaptation to new demonstrations, allowing for quick end-user personalization, (2) distills common knowledge across demonstrations, achieving accurate task inference; and (3) expands its model only when needed in lifelong deployments, maintaining a concise set of prototypical strategies that can approximate all behaviors via policy mixtures. We empirically validate that FLAIR achieves adaptability (i.e., the robot adapts to heterogeneous, user-specific task preferences), efficiency (i.e., the robot achieves sample-efficient adaptation), and scalability (i.e., the model grows sublinearly with the number of demonstrations while maintaining high performance). FLAIR surpasses benchmarks across three control tasks with an average 57\% improvement in policy returns and an average 78\% fewer episodes required for demonstration modeling using policy mixtures. Finally, we demonstrate the success of FLAIR in a table tennis task and find users rate FLAIR as having higher task ($p<.05$) and personalization ($p<.05$) performance. }

In this work, we focus on enabling generalization in \emph{assistive tasks}: tasks in which the robot is acting to assist a user (e.g. helping someone with motor impairments with bathing or with scratching an itch). Such tasks are particularly interesting relative to prior sim2real successes because the environment now contains a \emph{human who is also acting}. This complicates the problem because the diversity of human users (instead of merely physical environment parameters) is more difficult to capture in a population, thus increasing the likelihood of encountering out-of-distribution (OOD) human policies at test time. We advocate that generalization to such OOD policies benefits from (1) learning a good latent representation for human policies that test-time humans can accurately be mapped to, and (2) making that representation adaptable with test-time interaction data, instead of relying on it to perfectly capture the space of human policies based on the simulated population only. We study how to best learn such a representation by evaluating on purposefully constructed OOD test policies. We find that sim2real methods that encode environment (or population) parameters and work well in tasks that robots do in isolation, do not work well in \emph{assistance}.  In assistance, it seems crucial to train the representation based on the \emph{history of interaction} directly, because that is what the robot will have access to at test time. Further, training these representations to then \emph{predict human actions} not only gives them better structure, but also enables them to be fine-tuned at test-time, when the robot observes the partner act.}

In this paper, we propose to learn backjumping heuristics which identify the culprit action directly using supervised learning models to guide the task-level search. Based on evaluations of two different tasks, we find that our method significantly improves planning efficiency compared to backtracking and also generalizes to problems with novel numbers of objects.}

This paper introduces a novel cost-shaping method which aims to reduce the number of samples needed to learn a stabilizing controller. The method adds a term involving a Control Lyapunov Function (CLF) -- an `energy-like' function from the model-based control literature -- to typical cost formulations. Theoretical results demonstrate the new costs lead to stabilizing controllers when smaller discount factors are used, which is well-known to reduce sample complexity. Moreover, the addition of the CLF term `robustifies' the search for a stabilizing controller by ensuring that even highly sub-optimal polices will stabilize the system. We demonstrate our approach with two hardware examples where we learn stabilizing controllers for a cartpole and an A1 quadruped with only seconds and a few minutes of fine-tuning data, respectively. Furthermore, simulation benchmark studies show that obtaining stabilizing policies by optimizing our proposed costs requires orders of magnitude less data compared to standard cost designs.}

In our work, we claim that the distribution of DT's target-returns represents a series of different tasks that agents must learn to handle. Work in multi-task learning has shown that separating the representations of input data belonging to different tasks can improve performance. We draw from this approach to construct ConDT (Contrastive Decision Transformer). ConDT leverages an enhanced contrastive loss to train a return-dependent transformation of the input embeddings, which we empirically show clusters these embeddings by their return. We find that ConDT significantly outperforms DT in Open-AI Gym domains by 10\% and 39\% in visually challenging Atari domains.}

	abstract = {Autonomous vehicle (AV) stacks are typically built in a modular fashion, with explicit components performing detection, tracking, prediction, planning, control, etc. While modularity improves reusability, interpretability, and generalizability, it also suffers from compounding errors, information bottlenecks, and integration challenges. To overcome these challenges, a prominent approach is to convert the AV stack into an end-to-end neural network and train it with data. While such approaches have achieved impressive results, they typically lack interpretability and reusability, and they eschew principled analytical components, such as planning and control, in favor of deep neural networks. To enable the joint optimization of AV stacks while retaining modularity, we present DiffStack, a differentiable and modular stack for prediction, planning, and control. Crucially, our model-based planning and control algorithms leverage recent advancements in differentiable optimization to produce gradients, enabling optimization of upstream components, such as prediction, via backpropagation through planning and control. Our results on the nuScenes dataset indicate that end-to-end training with DiffStack yields substantial improvements in open-loop and closed-loop planning metrics by, e.g., learning to make fewer prediction errors that would affect planning. Beyond these immediate benefits, DiffStack opens up new opportunities for fully data-driven yet modular and interpretable AV architectures.}

	abstract = {Imitation learning offers a promising path for robots to learn general-purpose tasks, but traditionally has enjoyed limited scalability due to high data supervision requirements and brittle generalization. Inspired by recent work on skill-based imitation learning, we investigate whether leveraging prior data from previous related tasks can enable learning novel tasks in a more robust, data-efficient manner. To make effective use of the prior data, the agent must internalize knowledge from the prior data and contextualize this knowledge in novel tasks. To that end we propose a skill-based imitation learning framework that extracts temporally-extended sensorimotor skills from prior data and subsequently learns a policy for the target task with respect to these learned skills. We find a number of modeling choices significantly improve performance on novel tasks, namely representation learning objectives to enable more predictable and consistent skill representations and a retrieval-based data augmentation procedure to increase the scope of supervision for the policy. On a number of multi-task manipulation domains, we demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing imitation learning and offline reinforcement learning approaches.

In this work, we present a framework that learns semantics-aware locomotion skills from perception for quadrupedal robots, such that the robot can traverse through complex offroad terrains with appropriate speeds and gaits using perception information. Due to the lack of high-fidelity outdoor simulation, our framework needs to be trained directly in the real world, which brings unique challenges in data efficiency and safety. To ensure sample efficiency, we pre-train the perception model with an off-road driving dataset. To avoid the risks of real-world policy exploration, we leverage human demonstration to train a speed policy that selects a desired forward speed from camera image. For maximum traversability, we pair the speed policy with a gait selector, which selects a robust locomotion gait for each forward speed. Using only 40 minutes of human demonstration data, our framework learns to adjust the speed and gait of the robot based on perceived terrain semantics, and enables the robot to walk over 6km without failure at close-to-optimal speed}

We present a new approach that combines differentiable rendering with image translation to achieve temporal consistency over indefinite timescales, using surface consistency losses and neu- ral neural textures. We call this algorithm TRITON (Texture Recovering Image Translation Network): an unsupervised, end-to-end, stateless sim2real algorithm that leverages the underlying 3D geometry of input scenes by generating realistic- looking learnable neural textures. By settling on a particular texture for the objects in a scene, we ensure consistency between frames statelessly. TRITON is not lim- ited to camera movements — it can handle the movement and deformation of ob- jects as well, making it useful for downstream tasks such as robotic manipulation. We demonstrate the superiority of our approach both qualitatively and quantita- tively, using robotic experiments and comparisons to ground truth photographs. We show that TRITON generates more useful images than other algorithms do. Please see our project website: tritonpaper.github.io}

	abstract = {To solve tasks in complex environments, robots need to learn from experience. Deep reinforcement learning is a common approach to robot learning but requires a large amount of trial and error to learn, limiting its deployment in the physical world. As a consequence, many advances in robot learning rely on simulators. On the other hand, learning inside of simulators fails to capture the complexity of the real world, is prone to simulator inaccuracies, and the resulting behaviors do not adapt to changes in the world. The Dreamer algorithm has recently shown great promise for learning from small amounts of interaction by planning within a learned world model, outperforming pure reinforcement learning in video games. Learning a world model to predict the outcomes of potential actions enables planning in imagination, reducing the amount of trial and error needed in the real environment. However, it is unknown whether Dreamer can facilitate faster learning on physical robots. In this paper, we apply Dreamer to 4 robots to learn online and directly in the real world, without any simulators. Dreamer trains a quadruped robot to roll off its back, stand up, and walk from scratch and without resets in only 1 hour. We then push the robot and find that Dreamer adapts within 10 minutes to withstand perturbations or quickly roll over and stand back up. On two different robotic arms, Dreamer learns to pick and place objects from camera images and sparse rewards, approaching human-level teleoperation performance. On a wheeled robot, Dreamer learns to navigate to a goal position purely from camera images, automatically resolving ambiguity about the robot orientation. Using the same hyperparameters across all experiments, we find that Dreamer is capable of online learning in the real world, which establishes a strong baseline. We release our infrastructure for future applications of world models to robot learning.}

We present INQUIRE, the first algorithm to implement and optimize over a generalized representation of information gain across multiple interaction types. Our evaluations show that INQUIRE can dynamically optimize its interaction type (and respective optimal query) based on its current learning status and the robot's state in the world, resulting in more robust performance across tasks in comparison to state-of-the art baseline methods. Additionally, INQUIRE allows for customizable cost metrics to bias its selection of interaction types, enabling this algorithm to be tailored to a robot's particular deployment domain and formulate cost-aware, informative queries.}

	abstract = {In this work, we consider the task of improving the accuracy of dynamic models for model predictive control (MPC) in an online setting. Although prediction models can be learned and applied to model-based controllers, these models are often learned offline. In this offline setting, training data is first collected and a prediction model is learned through an elaborated training procedure. However, since the model is learned offline, it does not adapt to disturbances or model errors observed during deployment. To improve the adaptiveness of the model and the controller, we propose an online dynamics learning framework that continually improves the accuracy of the dynamic model during deployment. We adopt knowledge-based neural ordinary differential equations (KNODE) as the dynamic models, and use techniques inspired by transfer learning to continually improve the model accuracy. We demonstrate the efficacy of our framework with a quadrotor, and verify the framework in both simulations and physical experiments. Results show that our approach can account for disturbances that are possibly time-varying, while maintaining good trajectory tracking performance.}

	abstract = {Model-based reinforcement learning (RL) is a sample-efficient way of learning complex behaviors by leveraging a learned single-step dynamics model to plan actions in imagination. However, planning every action for long-horizon tasks is not practical, akin to a human planning out every muscle movement. Instead, humans efficiently plan with high-level skills to solve complex tasks. From this intuition, we propose a Skill-based Model-based RL framework (SkiMo) that enables planning in the skill space using a skill dynamics model, which directly predicts the skill outcomes, rather than predicting all small details in the intermediate states, step by step. For accurate and efficient long-term planning, we jointly learn the skill dynamics model and a skill repertoire from prior experience. We then harness the learned skill dynamics model to accurately simulate and plan over long horizons in the skill space, which enables efficient downstream learning of long-horizon, sparse reward tasks. Experimental results in navigation and manipulation domains show that SkiMo extends the temporal horizon of model-based approaches and improves the sample efficiency for both model-based RL and skill-based RL.

We collect two real-world datasets, a static tracking dataset and a controller-in-the-loop dataset, both annotated with object angle and angular velocity labels. Both datasets contain force-based tactile information on ten different household objects. We train an LSTM model to predict the angular position and velocity of the held object from purely tactile data. We integrate this model with a controller that opens and closes the gripper allowing the object to rotate to desired relative angles. We conduct real-world experiments where the robot is tasked to achieve a relative target angle. We show that our approach outperforms a sliding-window based MLP in a zero-shot generalization setting with unseen objects. Furthermore, we show a 16.6\% improvement in performance when the LSTM model is fine-tuned on a small set of data collected with both the LSTM model and the controller in-the-loop.

In this paper, we propose a method for panoramic 3D object tracking, called CC-3DT, that associates and models object trajectories both temporally and across views, and improves the overall tracking consistency. In particular, our method fuses 3D detections from multiple cameras before association, reducing identity switches significantly and improving motion modeling. Our experiments on large-scale driving datasets show that fusion before association leads to a large margin of improvement over post-hoc fusion. We set a new state-of-the-art with 12.6\% improvement in average multi-object tracking accuracy (AMOTA) among all camera-based methods on the competitive NuScenes 3D tracking benchmark, outperforming previously published methods by 6.5\% in AMOTA with the same 3D detector. }

Taking inspiration from contraction theory and integrating the QuaDUE for uncertainties, our novel CCM-based trajectory tracking framework tracks any feasible reference trajectory precisely whilst guaranteeing exponential convergence. More importantly, the convergence and training acceleration of the distributional RL are guaranteed and analyzed, respectively, from theoretical perspectives. We also demonstrate our system under unknown and diverse aerodynamic forces. Under large aerodynamic forces (>2~ m/s^2), compared with the classic data-driven approach, our QuaDUE-CCM achieves at least a 56.6\% improvement in tracking error.
